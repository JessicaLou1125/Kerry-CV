      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
      <h3>Handball Teams</h3>
      <p>I have been part of the handball team since Form 3 until now. In 2023, I represented the Macau Handball Association to participate in a handball competition in Hong Kong. Playing handball has improved my effective communication skills with teammates, and I have also learned to accept failure.</p >

      <h2>Extracurricular Activities</h2>
      <h3>Macao Public Security Police</h3>
      <p>These are very valuable groups that provide many opportunities for young people to learn different skills and values. Through participation in these activities, I have learned how to cooperate with others, build self-confidence, and develop leadership abilities. Additionally, I have met many friends who share common interests, and have expanded my social circle. These friends can become my mentors and confidants in the future, as we grow together and support each other in life.</p >
